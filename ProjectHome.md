## Why bother? ##

Agrajag's aim is to make a bit, but learn a lot ;) The objective is to create an arcade-like top-scroller 2D shooter game.

## Utilities ##

Agrajag is written in Python. It uses:
  * Pygame as its foundation
  * Phil's pyGame Utilities (abbr. PGU) - a mostly GUI library
  * lightweight Python XML DOM implementation (xml.dom.minidom)

Sometime/somehow it may use Psyco (but currently doesn't, as it's not available for x86-64, and that's what I /lavrin/ use).

## Description ##

The design (ughhh... if we can dignify it by using the word) of the game strives to allow for easy extension. Adding new enemies, bonuses, weapons, shields, etc. is a matter of creating the graphics and an XML description. At least it should be that easy...

Most artwork for the game comes from free internet sources. Some is created by the authors.

Agrajag features a level editor developed in PyQt4. Unfortunately, it's currently only a little more than a piece of crap.
